## 0.0.2

### Security

- Added per-request `x-nonce` signing to block replay within the timestamp window.
- Added `x-account-id` to the canonical signed message so account hints cannot be rebound in transit.
- Replaced relayer-mode `x-delegate-key` transport with ephemeral `x-mydata-session`; manual-mode requests no longer send delegate private key material.
- SDK versions that do not send `x-nonce` are no longer supported by the server and receive `426 Upgrade Required`.
