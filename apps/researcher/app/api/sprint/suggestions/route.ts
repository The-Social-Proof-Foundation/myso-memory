Generate:
1. A short, warm greeting (1-2 sentences max) that briefly tells the user what research you have context on. Be conversational and friendly — like a colleague who just finished reading through their materials. Don't say "Hello" or "Hi" — jump straight into what you know. Example tone: "I've gone through your research on X and Y — got a solid picture of the key findings and ${sprints.length > 1 ? "how they connect" : "what stands out"}."
2. 3-4 short, specific suggested questions (under 60 characters each) the user might want to ask. Make them diverse — cover key findings, comparisons, implications, and practical applications.`,
